Bug 1: 
emptySet_testIsEmpty failed
set a breakpoint at line 111 emptySet_testIsEmpty call
stepped into ArraySet constructor and confirmed it looked good
In the isEmpty method returned true if rear > 0, if rear > 0 it would have been populated and not empty
In line 40 I fixed this by returning true if rear == 0
re-ran tests and emptySet_testIsEmpty is passing

Bug 2:
emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty is failing
In line 147 I placed a breakpoint emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty call
In the add method of ArraySet it assigned the rear a value however rear wasn't updated
I fixed this by adding line 60, incrementing rear
re-ran tests and emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty is passing

Bug 3:
A_addB_AB_testRemoveA is failing
set a breakpoint at line 265 A_addB_AB_testRemoveA called
In line 74 of ArraySet it in the remove method a while loop shifting the index to account for the removed index was causing an out of bound error
The while loop was going to the previous rear, not accounting for the removed index
I fixed this in line 74 by setting the while loop to run while i < rear - 1
re-ran tests and A_addB_AB_testRemoveA was passing
all tests are passing
