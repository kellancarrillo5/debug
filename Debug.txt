Bug 1: 
The first bug I encountered was when emptySet_testIsEmpty failed.
To start solving this I set a breakpoint at line 111 in SetTester where emptySet_testIsEmpty was called.
First I stepped into the ArraySet constructor and confirmed it looked good.
Then I stepped into ArraySet isEmpty method. This method was causing the fail directly after it execcuted. 
After looking closer at isEmpty I found that it was returning true despite the set being empty.
I then found that isEmpty returned true if rear > 0. If rear > 0 the array would have been populated and not empty.
In line 40 I fixed this by returning true if rear == 0.
Then I re-ran tests and emptySet_testIsEmpty is passing.

Bug 2:
The second bug I identified was when emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty failed.
In line 147 of SetTester I placed a breakpoint where emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty was called. 
I then stepped into ArraySet and the constructor was working perfectly. Eventually I reached the add method. 
The contains method that was called within add was working properly, allowing add to proceed adding the element to the empty set. 
Then the new element was being added was assigned to the rear position successfully. 
I checked this by viewing the content of the array after it was added. 
After the method extended the capacity and assigned A to the rear, the rear value was never reassigned.
Ultimately the rear position staying 0 caused isEmpty to return true, making the test to fail.
I fixed this by adding line 60 by incrementing rear to the next value in the array.
After this fix I re-ran SetTester and emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty was passing.

Bug 3:
The final bug I found was when A_addB_AB_testRemoveA failed.
First I set a breakpoint at line 265 in SetTester where A_addB_AB_testRemoveA was called.
I stepped into ArraySet where A and B were successfully added. Then I stepped into ArraySet's remove method.
Remove was successfully finding and removing the character.
In line 74 of ArraySet a while loop was shifting the position of each item in the array to account for the removed index.
This was causing an out of ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsbound error.
After closer look at the loop I found it was reapeating to the previous rear, that no longer exsisted.
By not accounting for the removed index it ended up going one past the anticipated rear in the array, causing the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsbound error.
I fixed this in line 74 by setting the while loop shifting the array to run while i < rear - 1. 
After this fix I re-ran tests A_addB_AB_testRemoveA was passing along with everything else in SetTester.
