Bug 1: 
The first bug I encountered is when emptySet_testIsEmpty failed.
To start solving this I set a breakpoint at line 111 in SetTester.java where emptySet_testIsEmpty is called.
First I stepped into ArraySet constructor and confirmed it looked good.
Then I stepped into ArraySet isEmpty method. I then found isEmpty returned true if rear > 0. If rear > 0 it would have been populated and not empty.
In line 40 I fixed this by returning true if rear == 0.
Then I re-ran tests and emptySet_testIsEmpty is passing.

Bug 2:
The second bug I identified was when emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty failed.
In line 147 of SetTester I placed a breakpoint where emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty is called.
I then stepped into ArraySet's add method. After the new element was assigned to the rear position it was successfully added. 
However the rear value was never reassigned.
I fixed this by adding line 60, incrementing rear to the next value in the array.
After this fix I re-ran SetTester and emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty is passing.

Bug 3:
The final bug I found was when A_addB_AB_testRemoveA failed.
First I set a breakpoint at line 265 in SetTester where A_addB_AB_testRemoveA is called.
Then I stepped into ArraySet's remove method. Remove was successfully finding and removing the character.
In line 74 of ArraySet it in the remove method a while loop shifting the index to account for the removed index was causing an out of bound error in the array.
The while loop was going to the previous rear, not accounting for the removed index.
I fixed this in line 74 by setting the while loop to run while i < rear - 1.
I then re-ran tests and A_addB_AB_testRemoveA was passing along with everything else in SetTester.
